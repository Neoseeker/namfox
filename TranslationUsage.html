id="characters"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color:navy;"&gt;Characters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img471.imageshack.us/img471/121/nikobelliciz8.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/strong&gt; is the protagonist and player control character of Grand Theft Auto IV (GTA IV). He is from Eastern Europe. Niko is guilty of committing previous criminal acts in his life and wishes to escape his past and his home, where he has currently been having issues. He is persuaded by his cousin Roman to move to Liberty City where he lives the "American Dream" and Niko falls for the deception and arrives in Liberty City by boat. In the beginning Roman is the only person he knows in the entire city and must protect him from the many undesirables after their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new article on Xbox.com has confirmed Niko's nationality to be Russian, so that should end that little controversy.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Roman &lt;/strong&gt;is Niko Bellic's cousin who resides in Liberty City. Roman claims to be living the "American Dream" and that he has two women, four hot tubs and fifteen sports cars, but in reality owns a gritty taxi firm in the heart of the city. He successfully manages to persuade his cousin Niko to move to the city using his deception. Their relationship is strained and they are always bickering. Roman is also heavily in debt with various figures around the city.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/6418/elizevetafv9.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeta&lt;/strong&gt; is a female character in Grand Theft Auto IV. She is seen in promotional artwork for the game.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/strong&gt; is a Caribbean arms dealer who sells Niko weapons out of the trunk of his car. He and Roman are good friends.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/strong&gt; is a corrupt cop who has "dirt on Niko's past." In one mission, he meets up with Niko in an area called Castle Gardens which is a coast-side hangout overlooking The Statue of Happiness
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Goldberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tom Goldberg&lt;/strong&gt; is a lawyer working for Goldberg, Ligner & Shyster, a law firm based in Liberty City. In a demo presented to journalists by Rockstar, Niko kills Goldberg in his office, and then soon after ends up in a fire fight with law enforcement.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lola&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lola&lt;/strong&gt; appears on promotional artwork for the game and is said to be available for "special hours".
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
Here is a summary of all the previews from the the sites that were at the event :&lt;br /&gt;At Star Junction (the GTA IV equivalent of Times Square) there is a theatre show on called T.S Pirate at the Thespian Theatre, and a camera store called Liberty Cameras. On the way to Rotterdam (where Little Jacob is situated) they passed a cocktail bar called "Bahama Mamas."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Jacob is a Jamaican gun dealer from Dukes (the GTA IV equivalent of Queens.) The weapons on offer were $100 a piece.&lt;br /&gt;The name of each street is displayed at the bottom right of the screen as you enter it. During the demo, Niko passed through the following areas: Presidents City, Chinatown, Lancet, Hatton Gardens, Middle Park East, Lancaster, Ruby Street, Cod Row, Denver Avenue, Exeter Avenue, Northwood, East Holland, Silicon Street, Quartz Street, The Triangle, Easton, Diamond Street and Calcium Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hailing a taxi, you need to press Y to get in one, although the controls haven't been finalised. You have the option of sitting back and enjoying the ride, using the "trip-skip" option, or paying double the fare to make the driver go twice as fast. Inside the taxi, you can see and talk through to the driver in the front. The camera view changes every 5 seconds - read descriptions of the different camera views here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TW@ Café is located in Algonquin, north of Middle Park (Central Park.) Niko submits a fake résumé/cv to the Goldberg, Ligner & Shyster website, at McReary's request. For the interview he must to goto 44 Emerty Street, The Exchange, Algonquin (visit Kikizo to see dialogue from this mission.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a yellow light cone representing an objective, which triggers a cutscene when you walk into it.&lt;br /&gt;Francis McReary wears a black suit and tie, has a moustache and slicked blonde hair with a strong side parting. (dialogue of the conversation with McReary can be found here.) The person who blackmails McReary is at Union Drive East. McReary texts Niko the phone number of the blackmailer, so that he can phone it and identify who is the target. The name of the cell network is "Whiz." A black comet is used for this mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The default camera angle is slightly over to the drivers' side. Different angles are available however. You can move the camera aswell, but if you're not touching it, it will remain at the more central position leaning towards the drivers' side.&lt;br /&gt;Currently, the total number of wanted stars is 6 - the same as it was in previous Grand Theft Auto games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a GPS system in the car, and the recommended route shows up in yellow on the radar at the bottom left of the screen.&lt;br /&gt;You can auto-target as well as manual aim. Niko can take cover behind just about anything, and so can the cops.&lt;br /&gt;The TW@ Café is located in Algonquin, north of Middle Park (Central Park.)

That's because even without the brand, the hype and the moaning lawyers, it's shaping up to be a bloody impressive game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ushered in to a dark room by half of Rockstar's PR department (they're protective of their baby), we're greeted by a giant leather sofa, a giant HD telly and a bowl of sweets big enough to give Ronaldinho serious toothache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our second look at the game and we were promised a lot more action than what we saw (or didn't) in the first demo. This isn't the first mission in the game, rather the first mission Rockstar has shown anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;City's Slicker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of the second look is 'big fish in a small pond', and there's no better representation than when Rockstar boots up Star Junction - GTA's equivalent of Times Square - and little old Niko is blanketed by the bright lights of Liberty City's busiest corner. The code we're seeing is a couple of weeks old; the licensed soundtrack is still work in progress, voiceovers aren't all in and the lighting system has the occasional hiccup, but the scale and detail is already mighty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night sky allows the bright lights of Star Junction's building-tall signs to illuminate pedestrians - who all move very naturally thanks to a new centre of gravity. Without even moving we can see newspaper stands, bus stops, hot dog vendors (where the Left Bumper apparently buys you a hot dog - we're on a 360 pad) and a giant news ticker listing the weather for every corner of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out Rockstar PR aides promise that Star Junction is representative of all the detail lavished across the full game, which sports New York boroughs renamed to Broker (Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (Bronx), Algonquin (Manhattan) and Alderney (New Jersey). "All the streets are named as well," he notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we're tired of staring at the buildings and admiring walking animations; we demand action. Ahead of our threats to walk out the door without putting our Drum Stick wrappers in the bin, Niko hops on a nearby motorcycle and speeds up the street, to visit Rotterdam Hill and Little Jacob, who's a bit like the Del Boy of firearms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding that special someone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning in Liberty City Niko has a bit of a problem. A local police officer by the name of Francis McCrery has some dirt on Niko, and he's asking for a few favours to keep him quiet. The first of these favours is to take out a lawyer who's causing him trouble but the task is going to take Niko the whole day to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Jacob, a man with the guns in his car boot, is GTA IV's answer to Ammunation. The game is set in October 2007 and it's quite tricky walking into a gun store and buying an Uzi. It's not realistic and not possible. Instead, you'll find your shooters in Alleyways and the boots of cars, and our mate Little Jacob is sorting us out. There's a healthy selection of Uzis, rifles and grenades in the back of his motor, but the demoing Rockstar chap opts for a pistol and wracks up as many ammo clips as he can carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Niko's still trying to build a life for himself and he's getting to know the circle of friends that his cousin Roman knows," we're told. "As he evolves, he starts taking care of business and proving himself, he then starts to be trusted by a lot of these guys who he'll later come to rely."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we've got some fire power, Little Jacob takes off in his car and Niko's off to the local internet café to execute the second leg of the mission. The internet plays an integral part of today's modern life so it's no surprise to see it also playing a key role in GTA IV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun's starting to come up now and the shadows of buildings and objects stretch across the street. Niko walks out of the shady alleyway and flags down a cab with a typical Manhattan whistle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cabs are another example of the polish and detail that's gone into the fourth instalment. If this were GTA III we'd get a glowing marker and a destination menu, but Niko's cab ride is far more visceral. The camera jumps into first-person and the driver leans over the seat to ask Niko where he's off to. Using the fare machine you can mark exactly where on the map you want to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we've marked out the internet café on our map (which, in typical Rockstar fashion, is called TW@) it's simply a case of sitting back and enjoying the ride. Paying a double fare will cause the cabby to put his foot down, and you can skip the whole journey if you wish, but Rockstar fancies giving us a good look at the Liberty City streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graphically it's comparable to a grittier Saint's Row, but the magic really is in the detail. The road is no longer just a flat texture; there are random pot holes that dip and manipulate vehicles in a realistic way. The number of cars on the road at any one time has been massively increased, and each has its own characteristics. And dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety in buildings is impressive. In previous GTAs you could instantly tell between the useless 'filler' buildings and the places that actually require your attention. In GTA IV every building looks as though you could walk straight in to it - although obviously you'll only be able to enter a selection of Liberty City's real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it inside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's the most impressive part of GTA IV that we saw. Arriving at the cheekily named TW@, Niko pays his fare and walks straight inside the building. No loading times, no glowing markers, just a seamless progression from exterior to interior, which is wonderfully detailed. The café is littered with desks, computers, chairs, plants - even coffee mugs. The interiors of GTA IV don't look to have suffered at all graphically from being in a massive, free-roaming world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on topic and we're here because Niko has decided that the easiest way to get up close and personal with his lawyer target is to apply for a job interview. "I always wanted to be a lawyer," he jokes. GTA IV's virtual web browser lets you surf a whole number of pages written by the same team who scribe the rest of Liberty's City's comedy billboards, shop fronts and radio stations. Using Liberty City's homepage Niko navigates his way onto Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster's (the Target's law firm) to submit his dodgy-looking resume (which you can read in full!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything online is place holder for the moment so there's not much point going into detail, but it's immersive and we're promised there'll be plenty of fun things to do in the final game. Will it tie into Xbox Live and PSN though? A Swift "no comment" but the possibilities are massive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;link: &lt;a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=168874" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=168874&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
The last time we got a look at Grand Theft Auto IV, Rockstar showed us a rather modest taste of what to expect from its highly awaited crime epic, one that gave us only a basic idea of the kind of urban playground the developer was creating. More recently, Rockstar took all that theoretical stuff we've been hearing about with regard to the game's new mechanics, and put it into impressive action with a new demonstration of the Xbox 360 version that started answering our questions about how the designers will change the gameplay in the fourth iteration of their seminal open-world action series. Can they tinker with the formula that sold 900 billion games across the cosmos without damaging its core appeal? Our answer right now? Yeah, they probably can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, it was Rockstar who invented the open-world action model that has since influenced franchises from The Godfather to Crackdown to Jak & Daxter. Grand Theft Auto essentially defined that giddy sense of criminal freedom, by which you could wreak utter havoc on the hapless citizenry (and the citizenry's cars) with relative impunity and explosive aplomb. So it's ironic that it's Rockstar who is now restraining that freedom with GTA IV, which will place more immediate and noticeable limits on--and stricter consequences for--the sort of illicit behavior you can get away with as you go about your dirty business around Liberty City. The goal of this constrained design isn't to ruin your happy crime sprees, but rather to immerse you deeper into the world of Liberty City by making some of those explicitly gamelike elements of the GTA titles a little more realistic. We observed some of those limits and consequences in action during our demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockstar has gone to great lengths to re-create as much of New York City as it can cram into the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The session began with the game's poster boy for troubled pasts, protagonist Niko Bellic, starting out his day in Star Junction, which is GTA IV's version of Times Square. Niko received a cell phone call from crooked cop Francis McReary, who was intent on blackmailing Niko into running some shady errands. Your cell phone will act as one of your primary means of interacting with the residents of Liberty City. In past games, you merely accepted calls--and their associated missions--when they came in, as dictated by the story. But in GTA IV the phone is a two-way device, as you can just pop it up at the bottom of the screen, scroll through your list of contacts, and make a call when you need to reach out and touch the right (or wrong) person. In Rockstar's words, the cell phone is one new example of the way GTA IV will have you actively "instigating, not just reacting to" the world around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out, McReary wanted us to ice a lawyer who had been compiling evidence against the dirty cop. But unlike in past GTA games, the player had to go through a more subtle and lengthy process than simply striding into the law office, weapons ablaze, and gunning down every sucker in the place. What better way to get face-to-face with the lawyer in question without raising any eyebrows than to score a job interview with the jerk? To do that, we saw the player head to one of GTA IV's new Internet cafes, affectionately known as "TW@," and log onto the law firm's Web site to submit his resume and request an interview in person. Like with the cell phone, you'll be able to access a graphical interface that lets you surf the Web, check e-mail, and other basic functions whose purpose is primarily to tell you where to go and what to do next. Again like the phone, the Internet will act as a familiar real-world method of disseminating information and instructions to you without jarringly taking you out of the gameworld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before Niko could perform the hit, McReary helpfully pointed out that he would need some firepower to complete his task (yes, there will still be guns in the game). Niko was able to whip out his cell phone and ring up a "friend," a Rastafarian named Little Jacob who could help him get what he needed. Alas, in keeping with GTA IV's more realistic tone, you'll have to say goodbye to your beloved chain of Ammu-Nation stores. Guns won't be available from any mom-and-pop corner shop; you'll have to deal with shady characters like Jacob, who we saw selling a lovely array of automatic and semiautomatic weapons right out of his car trunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continue on to see how Rockstar has made the process of stealing a car more meaningful--and more dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV Update - A Day in Liberty City&lt;br /&gt;page 2 of 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we could get our dirty mitts on those guns, we had to make it from Star Junction to whatever dirty back alleyway Jacob was currently calling home. Now, the normal method of getting from point A to point B in past GTA games would be to find the nearest parked car--all of which conveniently seemed to have keys in the ignition, waiting behind unlocked doors--and go for a reckless joyride to your destination. Not so in GTA IV. Stealing a parked car involves an actual process this time around--you'll see Niko actually break out a window with his foot or his elbow, reach into the car and unlock the door, and then get in. Entry into the car will be followed by an animation lasting several seconds of Niko hotwiring the car, before he finally starts the engine and is free to drive away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can roll like this if you want to--but you'd better be ready to face the consequences of your actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that would just be so much protracted window dressing on the familiar act of, well, grand theft auto, if it weren't for the roving and very attentive eyes of the law. At various points in the demo, we saw the consequences of committing an offense within a police officer's line of sight--and yes, the list of offenses will include jacking a car. Even a minor crime like that will give you an instant wanted level, which will now be indicated on your mini-map as a physical search radius in which the fuzz is actively looking for you. You'll see driving and on-foot cops represented as distinct icons within the search area, and of course, the key to survival will be slipping out of the search area without being detected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may be easier said than done, though, because you'll actually hear the cops report your last known location and even the details of your appearance at the time you committed the crime. If another cop manages to spot you within the search radius, then your current position will become the new center of the search area and you'll have that much more ground to cover before you make it out safely. There are a number of tricks you can use to fool the cops, though. For instance, pull into a secluded alleyway where you're not within sight of the law, hop into a different car, and drive away peacefully and the cops won't be smart enough to recognize your new ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before heading off to meet Little Jacob, Niko stopped for a hot dog from a street vendor, which will replenish some of your health like past games' fast food grease pits (which will also return here). Given the potentially sticky consequences of stealing a car, the player in our demo opted to flag down a taxi cab (after being amusingly dissed by the first cab that drove by) and enjoy the scenic route to his destination. Again, you'll interact with the cab interface directly within the game world--you'll see a first-person view from the back seat, with possible destinations listed on the fare meter next to the cabbie up front. Lock in your drop-off point, and you'll be free to sit back and enjoy the ride through Liberty City, which is made visually interesting by a controllable camera angle from within the car. Luckily, if you're in a hurry you can choose to skip the travel and essentially warp to your location in a more timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, Niko had acquired his weapons and gotten a callback from the law office setting up an interview. So he had only to make himself look the part of an aspiring lawyer before he could cleanly get away with his dirty deed. That involved heading to one of the game's new clothing stores, Perseus, for a crisp new suit. You'll have at least a limited range of clothing customization options in GTA IV, though your affect on Niko himself will be more limited than in San Andreas. (No chance to pack on muscle or fat this time around.) Once he was dressed for success, the player took another cab to the law office, got buzzed in and was immediately led to the office of his target, where Niko sat down and began the interview process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to do your own navigating, every street in Liberty City will have a name this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting thing about the exchange was that Niko appeared to have the option to hang out and endure the interview process--namely, the lawyer's incessant blabbering--as long as he wanted. We didn't get to see what would happen if the conversation had gone through to completion, though, since the player eventually cut things short by standing up and aiming his gun at the lawyer. The poor guy mistook Niko's actions for an aggressive power play, and amusingly threw out the zinger that "guns don't kill people, videogames do" before Niko remorselessly popped him one. The gunshot naturally caused the secretary outside to flip out and sound the alarm, forcing Niko to fight his way out of the firm against a formidable police presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read on to find out how the shooting action has changed in GTA IV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV Update - A Day in Liberty City&lt;br /&gt;page 3 of 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematic, action-packed sequence looked like a traditional GTA shoot-out, though Rockstar reps pointed out that the shooting controls have undergone serious refinement. They didn't go into too much detail--saying that we'll have to get our hands on the game ourselves before we find out more about the shooting--but it looked to us like the auto-targeting will let you snap from one target to the next more quickly and easily than in the past. One new feature the reps did show us in detail was the new cover system, which lets you hunker down behind just about any flat surface, Gears of War-style to pop out with occasional aimed shots or even fire blindly over the edge of the cover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shooting action has been refined in GTA IV, with a new cover system and improved targeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll have to choose your position carefully, though, since some cover will be destructible, and police will be able to shoot it out after a few moments of heavy fire. This section of the demo ended with Niko out in the street, exchanging fire with numerous police before they caught up to him behind a street vendor's cart and killed him. We didn't get to see what happens after you die, but Rockstar said the process of getting apprehended or killed will result in trips to the jail or hospital, respectively, similar to the process in past games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got to see another sample mission in our time with GTA IV. McReary had yet another errand for Niko and summoned him to a dockside rendezvous for the details. Yet another cab ride later, Niko arrived and initiated a typical GTA-style cutscene in which McReary laid out the specifics of this job. Wouldn't you know it, he was being blackmailed by yet another shady character (the guy obviously has some skeletons in his closet), and he needed Niko to take the guy out. As luck would have it, this particular job was fast-tracked; McReary sent Niko straight to the payoff location to whack the blackmailer. The player in our demo decided to jack a secluded car this time and cruise over there himself, which gave us a look at the driving controls this time around. The only real change is that the camera angle has been offset slightly to the left while you're driving, which is intended to give a slightly more cinematic presentation. It didn't look like this new perspective would interfere with the actual feel of the driving much, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arriving at the crowded public park where the blackmailer was waiting, Niko received a text message from McReary containing the blackmailer's number, which was automatically entered into his phonebook (as all numbers sent to your cell phone will be). What happened next was one of the coolest and most unique things we saw in the entire demo, and again it tied into Rockstar's goal of making you feel more like you're really in the environment of Liberty City. Niko stood at the top of the observation deck area, looking down at the various people milling around, dialed the number and then scanned the crowd to see who picked up their cell phone just as the conversation started. Spying a man sitting on a bench nearby who had done just that, the player had to wait for the conversation to play out to confirm the identity of his mark by also making sure the same guy hung up his phone at the right time. Not surprisingly, he did, and Niko approached him from behind and pulled out his weapon. One bullet to the back of the head later, and Niko was fleeing from the scene--and the ever-present police--among the crowd of scattering, screaming onlookers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the demo, we were impressed at the scale of Liberty City--which should be expected by fans of GTA by now--but even more so at the finer details present in Rockstar's mock version of New York. Every street in the city has been named this time around, so you'll actually hear police announcing your last known whereabouts at a particular intersection, or you'll be able to chart your route as you take a taxi from Broker (i.e. Brooklyn) to Algonquin (or Manhattan). The various architectural styles of New York are naturally represented in the game's detailed environments, and we saw a diverse array of people crowding the streets. The details will extend to your own interactions, too. Niko will actively push people out of the way when they get too close, much like in Ubisoft's forthcoming Assassin's Creed, and one minor fender bender we saw in traffic resulted in an individual tail light getting busted out on the car in front of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello? Is it October 16 yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were assured that a variety of radio stations and other pop-culture references would appear in the game, though the limited amount of driving in our demo meant we weren't exposed to much music. However, we couldn't help noting that GTA IV doesn't lean heavily on one central influence in the way that Vice City was so clearly inspired by Scarface and Miami Vice, or San Andreas drew so heavily from Boyz n the Hood. Rockstar says parallels to previous movies and TV series will obviously be evident in some elements of the final game, but the company says it's attempting to create a fictional work that can better stand on its own as an original story than past games in the series. In their words, "it is an immigrant story in a version of New York...and that's it." Grand Theft Auto IV is now less than three months from its October 16 release date--so thankfully we won't have an excruciating wait before we get to see how that immigrant story plays out--and we hope to bring you more on the game before then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/grandtheftauto4/news.html?sid=6175585&tag=topslot%3Btitle%3B1&om_act=convert&om_clk=topslot&page=3" target="_blank"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;GTA:IV Missions Part 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
At any point in GTA IV Niko can pull out his mobile phone and use it to his heart's content. The phone shows up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and looks exactly how you'd expect a real phone to look, with a phonebook, buttons and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All GTAs have non-linear gameplay and player choice," says our right hand man, "the phone call extends that concept."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can phone up your contacts, text your arms dealer, access multiplayer games or even take photos with its built-in camera. The response time has been sped up for our demo and Niko quickly receives a phone call from Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster confirming his interview for later this afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertisement:&lt;br /&gt;Niko also fires a few calls to Officer McReary confirming his progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The previous GTAs have always accepted missions, but now you're taking part in the story by making the calls and choosing to make the calls yourself," says Rockstar. The most impressive use of Niko's phone came next...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guns go off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've got some time to kill before our big interview, so Niko decides to head towards the park and meet Officer McReary in person, helping him with another favour. The park is just as detailed as the city, with plenty of pedestrians, park benches and foliage - and on this work-in-progress demo code it's got a smoother framerate than the city as well (not that it's particularly bad in town).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stepping into a familiar glowing marker activates a cutscene, where McReary explains that he's ironically being blackmailed by someone with dirt on him. "I ain't guilty of nothing other than being a man," he says. "To be honest I don't care one way or another," responds Niko.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blackmailing party has a memory stick which contains compromising pictures of the officer. McReary's arranged to meet the blackmailer at a viewing point by the docks, and he's asking you to go and take the offending memory stick out of his hands. Niko flags down another cab and we're off to the docks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed music is still a big part of GTA, but Rockstar tells us it's yet to finalise the list of music for the fourth game. However, there's already plenty of the series' famous comedy averts up and running, including our favourite advertising manga flick, Princess Robot Bubblegum and the Horny Radioactive Plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's a half robot, half radioactive plant destined to take over the world. Only one 15-year-old school girl can stop it... by sleeping with it." Yatta!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko arrives at the docks and you can already see a large distinction between environments. The viewing point is a very cold, quiet area with just the chatter of seagulls and the humming of boats for company. Down by the benches and viewing pods there's quite a crowd enjoying the sea air. We're going to have to be creative to spot our man...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko pulls out his phone and scrolls down to the number McReary gave him in the park. It's the blackmailer's. Niko dials the number and straight away we can hear a phone going off. Mixed in with the crowd we spot a man dressed in black answering his mobile - bingo, that's our man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a great integration of the phone into the game world, and Rockstar says the target will never be in the same place twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no messing around here. Niko walks down some steps and makes his way through the crowd towards his mark. Approaching the man, he pulls out his gun, aims and shoots him square in the face. Blood splatters and he falls down realistically as the crowd scatters in terror. The memory stick floats above the ground just as with previous GTA item drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat and mouse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cops are quick on the case and Niko soon has gun shots whizzing passed his head. Niko runs up to the viewing platform and in to the street; the running animation is impressive, making use of the Euphoria engine to give him 'weight' with every step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outrunning the cops in GTA IV is a completely different affair to previous GTA games; this time around if they don't see you, they won't know where you are. This makes for a real game of cat and mouse; cop cars show up on your radar Metal Gear Solid-style and a round circle on your mini-map displays the cops' search radius. The higher the wanted level, the bigger the search radius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko manages to leg it around the block and locate a few parked cars. In GTA IV you actually have to hot wire stolen vehicles, which takes a lot longer than simply pulling the driver out of a moving vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we're moving we manage to escape the cops' search radius by carefully avoiding the patrolling squad cars. This brings our wanted level right down to zero and we're free to roam. If a cop was to spot us inside the radius, Rockstar notes, the search area would be re-centred on our current location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To us it looks like a much deeper, much more realistic way of doing things, and will almost certainly result in some fun games of cat and mouse online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alarm on Niko's phone beeps and we're alerted by a small HUD item that our job interview is only a short while away. We're not going anywhere in a tracksuit, says Rockstar, it's time to get suited and booted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko pulls up outside a small boutique, which again looks just as distinct as the non-enterable buildings around it. He walks into the store to find a large suit emporium, which has a purchase system similar to that of Dead Rising's. To pick up an item you simply walk up to it on the shelf or hanger, then choose to purchase or try it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around the customisation is more realistic. "There'll be no gigantic Nikos with pink Mohawks running around," we're told. We're in a bit of rush so Niko grabs a chocolate brown suit and is on his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding our way to Foldberg, Ligner and Shyster (where McReary asked us to kill a lawyer earlier in the day) is no problem at all, thanks to another new system handled by Niko's mobile. Is there nothing that phone can't do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the phone's GPS system, an orange path is marked out to our destination on the mini-map, and we follow it all the way to our job interview. It's a simple change but should help keep us from getting lost in GTA IV's sprawling metropolis, and perhaps even result in more casual gamers progressing in the single-player story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving at the Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster building, we're even more impressed by the progression from exterior to interior. It's a large building with steps leading up to a large glass entrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko presses the buzzer, introduces himself and explains he's here for a job interview. The receptionist buzzes him in and he opens the door to head inside. The animation, again, is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the most impressive aspect over San Andreas. The reception is as detailed as any linear action game, with plants, statues, reception desk and security guards - it's a world apart from the last game's blurry, empty apartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko has a quick chat with the receptionist and we're hastily escorted to the office of Mr. Goldburg; our next potential employer and the man who's life we're about to terminate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high level of detail continues through the office hallways of Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster. There's even cleaning trolleys with bottles of bleach, a mop and other pointless cleaning materials waiting to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ah, Mr Bellic!" Greets the navy-suited Goldberg as we're ushered through his office door, and sat down in front of his ivory desk. "Your CV is very impressive..." he continues, but Niko isn't here to chat. Niko stands up from his chair. "Good, I like a strong character." Niko pulls out his gun. "Whoa, put it away - lawyers don't kill people, videogames do!" A fine queue to Mr. Thompson, and our queue to get the hell out of there. Blam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gears of law&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately we can hear security scrambling through the halls and soon, police laying siege on the building from outside - another sense of environment previous GTAs could only dream of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko busts through the office door and puts a few bullets into the hall guard's chest. Free aim is a lot less cumbersome this time around, plonking the camera over Niko's shoulder for more precise - and less sporadic - shooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combat has been completely overhauled for GTA IV and frankly, it's about bloody time. Gone is the on-rails lock-on system from GTA III and in its place is a visceral, Gear of War-style cover system that makes shootouts far more complicated than tests of button mashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niko runs up to the cleaning trolley from earlier on and fires off a through shots at the security guards at the end of the hall. Enemies now react dynamically depending on where you shot them, and when poor champ even fell down the escalator when we nailed him in the knees. Ragdoll physics, naturally, are in full operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using pillars and doorways for cover Niko eventually makes his way to the entrance - and the police have turned up en masse. He gets away with hiding behind the reception desk for a while, but eventually the amount of plant pots and stationary being flung around by the crossfire flushes him out from hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cops are a fair bit smarter than in the PS2 days; they're diving around and finding cover almost as much as Niko is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover doesn't help much once Niko gets outside though; it's a proper siege with at least six police cars and over 20 cops. Police officers are aimed and in position behind their car doors and quickly Niko's getting mowed down from every direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the most chaotic thing we've seen in a GTA game; Niko tries to hijack a police car but another crafty cop driver swiftly smashes it down the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He runs towards a nearby petrol station but even that is quickly filled with GTA IV's colourful and toon-like explosions. The onslaught is too much and Niko's down on the floor. Game Over. And that was only three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city, messy gunfights and Niko's mobile are looking impressive then, but the seamless interiors and vastly improved combat system really made the demo for us. We'd still buy Free-Roaming Mafia Shooter IV, but this is distinctively GTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=168897" target="_blank"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
