# About the files

The TranslationRules.pack.js file is used by NAMFox for transation

# Editing the files

Edit the TranslationRules.js file and then go to http://dean.edwards.name/packer/ to create the pack file.  Make sure to enable "Base62 encode" and "Shrink variables".

You can test the translation by editing HtmlToMarkupTranslator.js and using the TranslationUsage.html to test the changes to translation.

Unfortunately, at this time the TranslationRules are not used by the HtmlToMarkupTranslator.js file so you have to edit both places to test the code.
